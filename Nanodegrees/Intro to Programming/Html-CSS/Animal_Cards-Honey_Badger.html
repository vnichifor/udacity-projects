			<p>They look more like a weasel than they do a badger. These creatures are long-bodied, with short legs and a broad girth. They have very loose and thick skin, giving them the ability to turn freely and fight when grabbed. They have long, coarse fur that lacks an undercoat. The fur on their back is white or grey, and from the shoulders down they are black.</p>
